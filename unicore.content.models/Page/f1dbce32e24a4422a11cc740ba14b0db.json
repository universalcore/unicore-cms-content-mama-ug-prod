This will help to keep her safe. If you cannot clean the floor, put down a large, clean blanket or mat.\r\n\r\nAs she grows up, your baby may like to play outside but, in some areas, worms are a problem. Worms are picked up from the mud and soil, and can cause belly pain, coughing and fever.\r\n\r\nThick socks, slippers or shoes will help to protect your baby when she starts to walk outside. Wash her hands well with soap and clean, safe water. It is also important to clean her nails regularly. This will stop worm eggs from the ground from entering her body when she puts her hands in her mouth.\r\n\r\nIf your child has a worm infection, you may not even know it. Deworming medicine kills any worms your child may have caught. This is safe for your child to take even if she has not caught any worms. Ask your health worker if your baby should take deworming medicine.\r\n\r\nOther ways to protect your baby from worms and germs: \r\n\u2022\tMake sure that the space outside your house is clean and free from the stools of people and animals. \r\n\u2022\tCover latrines to stop flies reaching them. \r\n\u2022\tKeep your baby away from open drains. \r\n\u2022\tWash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating them.\r\n",
