If you eat foods from these 4 main food groups you will get the minerals you need.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tFruit and vegetables. Eating lots of different coloured fruit and vegetables will give you lots of goodness.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tStarchy, filling foods, such as cassava, sweet potatoes, chapatti and matooke. Base your meals around starchy foods. This will give you plenty of energy.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tProtein-rich foods, such as beans, peas and ground nuts. These foods are also good sources of iron. They will help you to stay strong.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCalcium-rich foods such as cows\u2019 milk, silver fish (mukene), soya porridge. \r\n\r\nAdding a little salt to your food will give you iodine, because it is added to the salt in the packet. You need plenty of iodine in your diet to help your baby's brain to develop. Try to have some every day.\r\n\r\nBy eating a range of these foods you can stay fit and strong, as well as grow a healthy baby.\r\n",
