  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if you have never felt breathless before, like lots of women, you may sometimes feel breathless now. This is normal. Your body is adapting to being pregnant.\r\n\r\nYou can help your breathing by keeping away from dirty air and smoky places.\r\n\r\nDo you chew tobacco or smoke a pipe? Stop, or cut down now. It is bad for you and your baby\u2019s health.\r\n\r\nAsk your family to smoke outside. If your house is smoky, open doors and windows. \r\n\r\nYou can reduce smoke when you cook:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse a charcoal stove if possible.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse a lid. The pot can conserve heat and you can reduce cooking time, and so breathe in less \r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSoak food, especially dry food like beans, before cooking to reduce cooking time.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWhen cooking, spend as little time as possible in the kitchen. You could sit outside and only enter to check on the fire and food. Ask someone to help with blowing the fire if possible\r\n\r\n\u2022\tMopping can reduce the amount of dust you breathe in.\r\n\r\nIf you are breathless all the time, you may be anaemic. This means your body lacks iron. Taking iron tablets will help. You can also make sure you eat a variety of different foods like leafy vegetables, eggs, fruit, poultry, meat and offal. They all help your body to get iron.\r\n",
