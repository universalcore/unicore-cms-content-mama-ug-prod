This will keep your baby safe and healthy. \r\n\r\nA small amount of alcohol is usually safe, and if you had a small amount of alcohol before you knew you were pregnant, do not worry. But it is best not to drink any alcohol while you are pregnant. \r\n\r\nHere is why. Alcohol is a harmful substance. When you drink alcohol, it rapidly reaches your baby via your bloodstream. Heavy drinking can cause miscarriage and premature birth. Too much alcohol can even increase the risk of your baby being stillborn.\r\n\r\nIf you drink too much alcohol during pregnancy, it can damage your developing baby's cells forever. This could affect how your baby's face, organs and brain grow.\r\n\r\nSome people believe that taking alcohol gin (waragi) means a baby is born \u2018clean\u2019 and not covered in vernix. This is not true. Vernix is a white sticky substance that covers and protects the skin of your baby in the womb. It is normal for your baby\u2019s skin to be covered in vernix at birth. It helps to protect his delicate skin. Do not drink waragi.\r\n\r\nRemember that traditional medicines from the market often contain alcohol. So they are not good for you at all! They are bad for you and your baby, so do not use them.\r\n",
