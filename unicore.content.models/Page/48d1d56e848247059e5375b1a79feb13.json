Add cashew nuts and peanuts to your food to make it even healthier. Fruits like mangoes, oranges, papayas, guavas, bananas and jackfruits are good. Try to have 1 extra handful of food with every meal. Do not go without food for too long. Carry some food with you if you have to go somewhere.\r\n\r\n2.\tGet check-ups while you are pregnant. Try to have 4 visits to your health worker. Get your blood and urine tests and blood pressure checks done regularly. These tests help to find problems early. Then you can get treatment and keep yourself and your baby safe. \r\n\r\n3.\tGet tested for HIV. If you are HIV+, there are medicines to help keep you well and prevent your baby from being born HIV+. If you find out you are not HIV+, you can make sure you stay that way.\r\n\r\n4.\tTake your pregnancy tablets. These iron and folic acid (fefol) tablets help your baby grow well. Ask your health worker if you can get them free. \r\n\r\n5. Keep clean. Wash your hands with soap before cooking and eating and after using the toilet. \r\n",
