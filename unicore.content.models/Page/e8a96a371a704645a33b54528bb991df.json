This is because, as her stomach fills up with milk, her bowels get stimulated.\r\n\r\nBreastfed babies usually have yellowish stools which smell sweet, and they tend to be soft. After they reach 1 month old, most babies have 1 or 2 bowel movements a day.\r\n\r\nYour baby\u2019s stools may change at 6 months when she starts solid food. But bowel movements will settle down once your baby gets used to her new food. \r\n\r\nSo, notice your baby's stools. If your baby passes smelly, watery and mucus-streaked stools more often, has a fever or seems to be losing weight, then your baby probably has diarrhoea. Take her to a health worker.\r\n\r\nGive your baby ORS as you go to the health facility in case it takes time to get help. ORS is a powder which is dissolved in a litre of clean, boiled and cooled water. You can store this and use it over 8-12 hours. Give your baby 15-20 teaspoons of ORS after each loose stool. Spread the teaspoons out over half an hour.\r\n",
