If it does not, soak the penis in warm water, and gently unwrap the bandage. Apply antiseptic if the health facility gave it to you. If not, petroleum jelly can protect the wound from germs.\r\n\r\nThere may be some blood on your baby boy's nappy for a few hours after the procedure. Keep the nappy area clean. Wash his penis gently with clean, boiled salty water 3 times a day.\r\n\r\nChange his nappy as soon as it gets wet, to avoid infection. Leave your baby without a nappy. Fresh air will help the wound to dry. Dressing him in loose clothing also helps the healing process.\r\n\r\nYour baby may feel some pain. Give him a painkiller if the health worker prescribed it. Offer him your breast to comfort him.\r\n\r\nThe wound should heal within 1 or 2 weeks. Take him to the health facility if his penis is red and swollen after 2 to 3 days, if he is still bleeding or if he is  passing urine less often than normal.\r\n\r\nRemember: it is never safe to circumcise a girl at any age.\r\n",
