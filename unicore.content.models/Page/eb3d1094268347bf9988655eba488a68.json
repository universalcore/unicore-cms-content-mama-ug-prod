  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is really important to take care of your own body as well as your baby. If you feel fit and well you will cope better with the demands of everyday life\r\n\r\nIt is easy to focus all of your attention on your baby and forget about yourself. But your body has been through a lot. If you have problems, act early. \r\n\r\nPlan ahead in case there is an emergency. Decide who will look after your other children if you or your baby are ill. Also decide how you will get to a health worker or health facility and who you will take with you.\r\n\r\nTry to find the fastest route and the quickest form of transport. You may need some money for this, so start putting a little bit aside just in case. It will give you peace of mind.\r\n\r\nIf you have any of these signs, go to a health worker for help.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou are bleeding heavily\r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou are breathless and have a pain in your chest\r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou have a fever and feel unwell \r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou cannot pass urine \r\n\r\n\u2022\tYour belly feels tender to touch\r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou have sticky, smelly fluid coming from your vagina\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIt stings or burns when you pass urine\r\n\r\nGet help quickly so you can recover quickly too.\r\n",
