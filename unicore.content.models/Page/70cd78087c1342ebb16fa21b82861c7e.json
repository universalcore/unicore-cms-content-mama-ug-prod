  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nBreathing in smoke is harmful for you and your baby. \r\n\r\nIf your house is smoky, let in as much fresh air as possible. Open the windows and doors. This will help. Explain to other people what effect their smoking will have on your baby growing inside you. \r\n\r\nStay away from smoke. Smoke can make you weak and sick. Try to stay in the least smoky part of the house. \r\n\r\nAsk family and friends to smoke outside. \r\n\r\nYou could also try some of these ideas:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCook in a separate building or move your stove outside if you can, so less smoke goes in the house\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse a charcoal stove if possible.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse a lid. The pot can conserve heat and you can reduce cooking time, and so breathe in less smoke.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSoak food, especially dry food like beans, before cooking to reduce cooking time.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWhen cooking, spend as little time as possible in the kitchen. You could sit outside and only enter to check on the fire and food. Ask someone to help with blowing the fire if possible\r\n\r\n\u2022\tMopping can reduce the amount of dust you breathe in.\r\n",
