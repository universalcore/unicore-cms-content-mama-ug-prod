You may become anaemic - this is when you do not have enough iron in your blood, which makes you short of breath and weak. \r\n\r\nHere are some ways to protect yourself and your baby from malaria:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSleep under an insecticide-treated bed net, even if the weather is hot.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tMosquitoes are attracted to dark colours. Wear light-coloured clothing, especially if you go out in the \r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tStop mosquitoes getting to your skin by wearing long sleeves and full-length clothes. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tIf possible, use a spray against mosquitoes or mosquito coils in the house. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tMosquitoes live in stagnant water, rotting leaves and damp areas. Check that there are none of these around your home.\r\n\r\nThe health facility may give you medicine to take to help prevent malaria.  But remember that this medicine will not cure malaria if you have already got it.\r\n",
